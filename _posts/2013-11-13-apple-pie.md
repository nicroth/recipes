This apple pie is the best you'll ever taste. 


#### Filling Ingredients
- 6-8 Jonathan apples
- 1 cup sugar
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- A dash of ground nutmeg
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- A dash of salt
 
#### Pastry Ingredients
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2/3 cups shortening
- 5-7 tablespoons cold water



#### Tools

- Two large mixing bowls
- Pie pan (glass)
 
#### Filling Directions

Core, peel, and thinly slice apples. Combine sugar, flour, spices, and salt. Mix apples with spices. Add lemon juice. Stir well and set aside. The mixture should become juicy with time.


#### Pastry Directions
Mix salt and flour. Cut in half of the shortening with a fork until it has a cornmeal texture. Cut in the second half of shortening until the mix is like small peas. Sprinkle with water gradually. Mix until all flour is moistened. Form into two balls. Roll out on floured surface, starting from the center.


#### Finishing Directions
Place one layer of pastry into the bottom of a pie pan. Fill with apple mixture. Dot with butter. Place the second pastry on top.  Perforate top pastry with a fork or knife. Seal two pastries by pressing together. Decorate with fork prints around edge if desired. Sprinkle with sugar. Bake at 400 degress for 55-60 minutes. To prevent browning, cover edges of pie with aluminum foil.
