This recipe is the easiest way to a delicious pork base for several Mexican-inspired dishes.

#### Ingredients
- 2 lb+ pork butt or shoulder
- 1 white onion
- 1 bunch cilantro
- 1 pineapple
- 1-2 oranges
- 2-3 limes
- 1 tablespoon ghee or other cooking fat
- Chili powder
- Salt
- Cumin


 
#### Tools

- Slow cooker
- Large frying pan or wok
 
#### Directions

Rinse pork and place in slow cooker. Coat meat with chili powder, cumin, salt. Juice the limes and oranges, cover meat with juices. Core and slice pineapple into rings. Layer pineapple rings directly on top of the meat. Cook on low for 6-9 hours, until fork-tender. Once meat is tender, shred with a fork. Slice onion to desired shape. Heat large frying pan to high and place the ghee into the pan. Fry the shredded meat and onion together in the pan until one side of the meat is crispy. Serve with freshly chopped cilantro over top alongside a scoop of guacamole. Can be used as filling for tacos, burritos, or other similar dishes.
